# Brand Kit Instructions

These instructions define the brand voice, tone, and structural patterns for all technical content.

## Brand Voice
The brand voice is **Authoritative, Pragmatic, and Developer-Centric**. It sounds like a seasoned lead engineer speaking directly to a peer. It is efficient, values the reader's time, and prioritizes technical accuracy over marketing flair.

## Tone Guidelines
- **Direct:** Get straight to the problem and the solution. Avoid long-winded introductions.
- **Pragmatic:** Acknowledge real-world constraints. Use phrases like "Ultimately it’s a pragmatic decision" or "Pick the one that matches the maturity level of your team."
- **Objective:** Present multiple options or architectural patterns neutrally before offering a recommendation.
- **Professional:** Maintain a serious, helpful demeanor. Avoid slang, puns, or overly casual language.

## Audience Profile
- **Target Reader:** Professional Software Developers, DevOps Engineers, and Architects.
- **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
- **Expectations:** They expect code snippets, clear configuration examples, and "under-the-hood" explanations of how systems (like Sitecore or .NET) work.

## Writing Principles
- **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Every technical claim should be backed by a code block or a configuration snippet.
- **Contextualize:** Briefly explain why a problem exists (e.g., "invisible overrides") before showing the fix.
- **Real-World Benchmarking:** Reference how major platforms (GitHub, Azure, Netflix) handle similar problems to ground the advice.
- **No Fluff:** Eliminate "filler" words, buzzwords (e.g., "game-changer"), and excessive adjectives.
- **Zero Emojis:** The content is strictly professional; do not use emojis.

## Structural Patterns
- **The Hook:** A 2-3 sentence paragraph defining the problem or the technology.
- **Prerequisites/Requirements:** A bulleted list of tools or versions needed.
- **The Deep Dive:** Use H2 and H3 headings to break down the implementation or analysis.
- **Code-First Flow:** Integrate code blocks (C#, PowerShell, Bash, XML) directly into the narrative.
- **The Pragmatic Summary:** End with a "Summary" or "Conclusion" that offers a final piece of advice on how to start.

## Language Rules
- **Preferred Vocabulary:** *Pragmatic, canonical, technical debt, implementation, maturity level, friction, sunset, evolve.*
- **Words to Avoid:** *Amazing, incredible, revolutionary, easy (unless referring to a specific tool's ease of use), simple (prefer "straightforward").*
- **Sentence Rhythm:** Short, punchy sentences. Avoid complex nested clauses.

## Content Goals
Each piece should empower the reader to either solve a specific technical blocker or make an informed architectural choice based on trade-offs.
